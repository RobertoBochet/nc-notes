\chapter{Passive systems}

\section{Definition}

\begin{gather*}
    \begin{cases}
        \dx (t) = f(\x,u) \\
        y(t) = g(\x,u)
    \end{cases} \\
    f(\vect 0,0) = \vect 0, \quad g(\vect 0,0)=0
\end{gather*}

A dynamical system is called \textbf{passive} if there exists a \textbf{Lyapunov function} $\V(\x)$ called \textbf{storage function}, such that

\[
    uy \geq \pd{V}{\x}(\x) f(\x,u) + \epsilon u^2 + \delta y^2 + \rho \psi(\x)
\]

with

\[
    \epsilon \geq 0, \delta \geq 0, \rho \geq 0, \psi(\x) > 0
\]

Notice that the Lyapunov function can be written as

\[
     \pd{\V}{\x} f(\x,0) = \dV(\x)
\]

\subsection{Conservative system}

A passive system is called \textbf{conservative} if $\epsilon = \delta = \rho = 0$, such that

\[
    uy = \pd{V}{\x}(\x) f(\x,u)
\]

\subsection{Strictly passive}

A passive system is called strictly passive if any of $\epsilon, \delta, \rho$ is greater that $0$.
In particular

Strictly passive w.r.t the input if $\epsilon > 0$ \\
Strictly passive w.r.t the output if $\delta > 0$ \\
Strictly passive w.r.t the state if $\rho > 0$

\subsection{Zero-state observable}

A system is \textbf{zero-state observable} if $\x(t) = 0$ is the only \textbf{free evolution} (u=0) of the state compatible with identically zero output (y=0)

\section{Properties}

\begin{theorem}
    If a system is \textbf{passive} with positive definite storage function, then $\x=0$ is a \textbf{stable} equilibrium for the system with zero input
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If a system is \textbf{strictly passive w.r.t the state} with positive definite storage function, then $\x=0$ is an \textbf{asymptotically stable} equilibrium for the system with zero input
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If a system is \textbf{strictly passive w.r.t the output} and \textbf{zero-stable observable} with positive definite storage function, then $\x=0$ is an \textbf{asymptotically stable} equilibrium for the system with zero input
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If the storage function associated to \textbf{asymptotically stable} equilibrium is radially unbounded then the equilibrium is \textbf{GAS}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If a system is \textbf{zero state observable} and \textbf{passive} with positive definite storage function and \textbf{radially unbounded}, then $\x=0$ is a \textbf{GAS equilibrium} of the output feedback system with control law
    \[
        u=-\phi(y),\qquad \phi(0)=0, \quad y\phi(y)>0, \forall y \neq 0
    \]
\end{theorem}
