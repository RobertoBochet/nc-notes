\chapter{Switched systems}

\section{Definition}

A switched system is a system whom the state dynamics is described by a set of \textbf{more than one} vector fields;
at specific moment the state dynamics is controlled by only one of these vector fields.
The switching between these dynamics can be controlled by exogenous variable (\textbf{time-dependent switching}) or defined in function of the state (\textbf{state-dependent switching}).

The system is defined by

\[
	\begin{cases}
		\dx = \vect f_q(\x), \qquad q \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\} \\
		\sigma(\cdot): U \to Q
	\end{cases}
\]

a family of $m$ systems characterized by their vector fields $\vect f_q(\x)$ and a function $\sigma(\cdot)$ which determines the current one is in use.

\section{Equilibrium}

\begin{theorem}
	If a switched system defined by
	\[
		\dx = \vect f_q(\x), \qquad q \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\}
	\]
	has $\vect f_q(\vect 0) = \vect 0, \forall q \in Q$ then $\x = \vect 0$ is an equilibrium of the switched system.
\end{theorem}

\begin{nb}the stability of an equilibrium of the $m$ systems of the family tells us nothing about the stability of switched system\end{nb}

\section{Stability}

\subsection{Stability for arbitrary switching}

\begin{definition}[globally uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium]
	The equilibrium $\x=\vect 0$ is \textbf{GUAS} if it is \textbf{GAS}, uniformly w.r.t. the switching signals $\sigma$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	If the family of systems share a \textbf{radially unbounded common Lyapunov function} then the equilibrium $\x=\vect 0$ of the switched system is \textbf{GUAS}.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Linear system}

A switched system can have a family systems of linear ones such that

\[
	\dx = A_q \x, \qquad q \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\}
\]

\begin{theorem}
	If for a switched system with a family systems of linear ones exists a matrix $P = P^\trans > 0$ such that
	\[
		PA_q + A_q^\trans P < 0, \qquad \forall q \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\}
	\]
	then, the equilibrium $\x=\vect 0$ of the switched system is \textbf{GUAS}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	If a switched system with a family systems of linear ones has $A_q, \forall q \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\}$ \textbf{Hurwitz}\footnote{All of its eigenvalues have negative real part} and \textbf{commutative}\footnote{$A_i A_j = A_j A_i, \forall i,j \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\}$} then, the equilibrium $\x=\vect 0$ of the switched system is \textbf{GUAS}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	If a switched system with a family systems of linear ones has $A_q, \forall q \in Q = \{1,2,\dots,m\}$ \textbf{Hurwitz} and \textbf{triangular} then, the equilibrium $\x=\vect 0$ of the switched system is \textbf{GUAS}.
\end{theorem}
